            <h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>We first met at my aunt's house in Arcola, Louisiana after he got back from serving 4 years in the Marine's. He was visiting his friend, who happened to be my cousin. He mentioned to my cousin that he thought I was cute and that he wanted my number. Due to the ten year age difference, and knowing how my dad is, my cousin asked if she could give it to him, and I said yes.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>We tried being together, but I was young and something was a little off. We went our separate ways and stayed friends. We stayed friends for several years and in 2019, we hung out and we decided to try again. In 2020, he met the family. We have been together ever since. In four short years, Aaron gained a dog, Stella. And I have gained a step-son, Ryder. We have bought a house and settled our life in Purvis, Mississippi.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>In June 2024, we spent the weekend in Pensacola, Florida with several family members. On the 15th, we ate dinner and walked down to the beach. With everyone in on it except my mom and I, he got down on one knee and proposed. As you can see, I said, "yes!"</strong></p>
